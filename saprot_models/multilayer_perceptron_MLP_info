Build a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to classify residues in secondary structures
This is a simple classification task:

Input: per-residue embedding vector

Output: one of the 3 secondary structure classes:

H → helix
E → sheet
C → coil
MLP architecture:

Input layer: embedding dimension (480)

Hidden layer(s): 256 → 128

Dropout (optional)

Output: 3-way softmax

Train two separate models:

MLP_seq_only
MLP_seq+3Di
Use cross-entropy loss and early stopping.

Goal: Compare accuracy on test residues.
